Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. 
My project takes in a submission from the form featuring name, favorite color, favorite number, and a selection of favorite foods to calculate your favorite car based on a series of array values. 
I restructured a lot of assignment 3. I created 2 new folders client and server. The client folder is meant for the react front end of the app and the server folder is meant for the express backend of the app. 
I moved my files that were for the React application portion to the client side of the folder including assigment 3 files such as index.html and app.js. From there i created index.js and styles.css which replaced my main.css
I moved my files that were for the Express portion to the server side folder including assignment 3 files such as Name.js and User.js. I also updated my server.js to handle Passport github authentication
The major change since assignment 3 was the connection to MongoDB is now working! I tested using local machine connection and that seemed to solve the issue.
